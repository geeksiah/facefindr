2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
FaceFind operates as a standalone SaaS platform with integrations to external services for
facial recognition, payment processing, and cloud infrastructure. The system is designed with a
service-oriented architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and rapid iteration.

2.1.1 System Context
Frontend: Next.js web application hosted on Vercel; React Native mobile applications for
iOS and Android
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Edge Functions, Storage)
Facial Recognition: AWS Rekognition for face detection, embedding generation, and
matching
Payments: Stripe Connect (Express) for attendee payments and photographer payouts
Subscriptions: Stripe Billing for photographer SaaS subscriptions
Print Fulfillment: Platform-owned print production and shipping infrastructure
2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
2.2.1 Photographers (Primary Paying Users)
Professional or semi-professional photographers who shoot events including weddings,
corporate functions, sports competitions, concerts, and public gatherings. They require efficient
workflows for bulk uploads, flexible monetization options, and reliable payout mechanisms.

2.2.2 Attendees (End Users)
Event participants who want to find and obtain photos of themselves. They access the platform
through shared links or directly via the mobile app. Attendees may create persistent accounts
for cross-event photo collection or remain anonymous for single-event access.

2.2.3 Platform Administrators
Internal staff responsible for system monitoring, photographer support, dispute resolution, and
platform configuration.

2.3 Operating Environment
Component Requirements
Web Browsers Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+
iOS iOS 14.0 or later, optimized for iPhone
Android Android 8.0 (API 26) or later
Connectivity Internet connection required; offline viewing of previously loaded content
Camera Device camera required for face scanning; minimum 2MP front-facing
camera
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
No biometric processing logic implemented internally; all facial recognition delegated to
AWS Rekognition
Face embeddings must be scoped to events; cross-event matching only for registered
attendees with consent
Platform is not the merchant of record; Stripe Connect handles funds
GDPR, CCPA, and BIPA compliance required for biometric data handling
Print fulfillment handled by platform-owned infrastructure, not third-party marketplace
3. User Accounts and Identity System
3.1 Photographer Accounts
3.1.1 Registration
MUST: Photographers register with email and password. MUST: Email verification required
before account activation. MUST: Password requirements include minimum 8 characters with
mixed case and numbers. SHOULD: Support social login via Google and Apple.

3.1.2 Profile Management
MUST: Photographers can update display name, business name, and profile photo. MUST:
Photographers can update email with re-verification. SHOULD: Support portfolio links and social
media handles.

3.1.3 Session Management
MUST: Sessions persist across browser restarts with secure tokens. MUST: Support concurrent
sessions across web and mobile. MUST: Sessions expire after 30 days of inactivity.

3.2 Attendee Accounts
3.2.1 Account Types
Anonymous Access: Attendees can access individual events without creating an account.
Face scans are stored only for the event session. No cross-event matching.

Registered Accounts: Attendees create accounts with email/password or social login. Receive
FaceTag identifier for Photo Passport. Persistent face profile enables automatic photo discovery
across all events.

3.2.2 FaceTag Identifier System
MUST: Every registered attendee receives a unique FaceTag upon account creation. MUST:
FaceTag format is @[username].[4-character alphanumeric suffix] (e.g., @amara.k7x2). MUST:
Username portion is user-selected, subject to availability. MUST: Suffix is system-generated to
guarantee uniqueness. SHOULD: FaceTag can be changed once per 12-month period. MUST:
Old FaceTags redirect to new FaceTag for 90 days.

3.2.3 Photo Passport Feature
The Photo Passport is the attendee's shareable identity for automatic photo delivery.

What Photo Passport Contains (Backend): FaceTag identifier (public), encrypted face
embedding reference (never exposed), notification preferences, pre-granted consent for face
matching, display name.

What Gets Shared: Only the FaceTag identifier. No face data, email, or personal information is
transmitted.

Sharing Methods: MUST support sharing via text string, QR code display, tap-to-share (NFC
where supported), and copy-to-clipboard.

3.3 Face Profile System
3.3.1 Initial Face Scan
MUST: Guided capture flow prompting user to center face in frame. MUST: Capture 3-5 angles
through subtle head turn prompts. MUST: Liveness detection to prevent photo-of-photo attacks.
MUST: Store multiple embeddings as primary face profile.

3.3.2 Smart Face Profile Refresh
The system uses a hybrid approach combining passive learning and active prompts to maintain
accuracy.

Layer 1: Passive Embedding Collection

MUST: Every successful event face scan is stored as supplementary embedding data. MUST:
Matching algorithm uses all available embeddings for improved accuracy. SHOULD: Weight
recent embeddings higher in matching.

Layer 2: Confidence-Based Refresh Prompts

MUST: System monitors rolling 90-day average match confidence per user. MUST: When
confidence drops below 75%, prompt user to update. MUST: Prompt options include Update My
Photo, These Are Me (confirms matches), Not Me (flags false positives).

Layer 3: Time-Based Refresh Schedule

User Age Refresh Cadence Prompt Type
Under 13 Every 6 months Required before matching
13 - 18 Every 9 months Strong prompt
18 - 25 Every 12 months Soft prompt
25 - 50 Every 18 months Soft prompt
50+ Every 24 months Soft prompt
Layer 4: Self-Declared Appearance Changes

MUST: Settings include Update My Photo option with common reasons (new hairstyle, facial
hair, new glasses, weight change). MUST: User can choose Add to Profile (augments existing)
or Replace Profile (for permanent changes). MUST: Temporary change option for
costumes/makeup.

3.3.3 Face Profile Privacy Controls
MUST: Users can view list of all events where their face data is stored. MUST: Users can
remove their face from specific events. MUST: Users can delete entire face profile. MUST: Face
deletion removes all embeddings and triggers deletion at AWS Rekognition.
